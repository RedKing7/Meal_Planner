# Project 2
## [Meal Planner](https://mighty-wildwood-25730.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview
This app helps individuals and households plan meals, and keep track of what ingredients are needed, what day meals are planned for, and who is scheduled to cook.

In the future, I would like to add some way to login to a user or household account, and find a way to display planned meals in a calendar format (this would likely require adding another layer of schemas, or perhaps using a relational database instead of mogoose)

All models and routes have full CRUD functionality.
